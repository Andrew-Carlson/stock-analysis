# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, the VBA script that was made in Module 2 to analyze stocks will be refactored, which is a redesign of the code to make it more efficient, take up less memory, and can potentially be made easier to read. The VBA script analyzed stocks that are in Excel worksheets named by year. The worksheets contains multiple stocks and accompanying information including price information (open/close/adjusted close/high/low) and trading volume for a given date. A table output of total daily volume and percent of return for all the stocks is made using VBA with the ability to input a year of interest in an input box to show the stock information for that year. A message box will also display the amount of time it takes for the code to run to compare the code before and after refactoring.
